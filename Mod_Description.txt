	Are you tired of the uselessness of the First Aid skill in vanilla Project Zomboid? The First Aid Vaccines mod revamps the skill, allowing you to craft vaccines that increase your chance of survival in the zombie apocalypse.

	Benefits:
	- Makes First Aid Skill More Useful: With the First Aid Vaccines mod, the First Aid skill is no longer just a secondary skill. By allowing players to craft vaccines that offer protection against zombie infections, the mod gives players a tangible reason to invest in the First Aid skill and use it to their advantage.
	- Adds an Extra Layer of Strategy: The addition of vaccines adds an extra layer of strategy to the gameplay. Players must now make the choice of whether to risk infection and avoid the extra steps needed to create a vaccine, or take the time to create a vaccine and ensure greater protection against zombie bites.
	- Improves Survival Odds: By offering protection against zombie infections, the First Aid Vaccines mod improves a player's odds of surviving in the zombie apocalypse. With increasing effectiveness of vaccines as the player's First Aid skill improves, the mod offers a satisfying progression system for players to work towards.
	- Fits with Core Gameplay: The First Aid Vaccines mod complements the core gameplay of Project Zomboid, which emphasizes exploration and survival. The mod requires players to scavenge the world for the necessary ingredients to craft vaccines, adding to the immersive survival experience.
	- Adds Practical Skill Improvement: The mod provides a new and practical way to improve the First Aid skill in Project Zomboid, beyond the usual method of stepping on broken glass and bandaging to improve First Aid.
	
	How do I create a Vaccine:
	- First get a knife or even better, a scalpel
	- Next kill a few zombies and Extract DNA from them
	- Once you obtain zombie cells from the dead zombies boil them using hot water
	- Next you need to gather syringes from hospitals/dental practices, or sterilize dirty ones found in dumsters or trash bins.
	- Now you can craft a vaccine with the zombie cells, syringe, and other supplies.

	How do vaccines work?

	Upon taking a vaccine, your immunity will slowly increase over the next 7 days. After that, your immunity level will start to fade away over the next 24 days. It's recommended to take another vaccine as a booster occasionally to maintain a high level of immunity.
	
	If you have the Moodle Framework mod installed then this mod will display a moodle letting you know when your immunity level is falling and below peak levels. It is not a requirement though.

	If your immunity level is high and you get hit or bitten by a zombie, you have a chance of preventing the infection. The chance of avoiding infection depends on the type of vaccine you've taken.

	The following is a breakdown of each vaccine and their infection prevention chance once at their peak:
	
	1. Boiled Zombie Cells - 15% chance - lvl 0 First Aid
	2. Crude Zombie Vaccine - 35% chance - lvl 3 First Aid
	3. Simple Zombie Vaccine - 60% chance - lvl 5 First Aid
	4. Effective Zombie Vaccine - 95% chance - lvl 8 First Aid
